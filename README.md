To run the projects you need to have node installed

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run watch`
3. Open index.html with live-server

To open up _index.html_ I recommend installing

`Name: Five Server (Live Server) Id: yandeu.five-server Description: Dev Server with Live Reload. (Maintained Fork of Live Server) Version: 0.0.32 Publisher: Yannick VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yandeu.five-server`

Tests can be ran using

`npm run test`
